        <h3>1. White Hat</h3>
        <strong>The Dataset</strong>
        <p>The dataset we used for the White Hat visualization is the Greenhouse Gas Emissions data. We used data from
            years 2014 to 2022 for total emissions excluding land use and forestry, measured in thousands of kilograms
            of CO2-equivalent emissions per person. </p>
        <p>We chose to focus on how the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions have changed over time across the
            world, which led us to filter the data solely into the year, the total emissions, and the reference area. We
            chose to include all pollutants, since all of them contribute to the effect of the greenhouse gas presence
            in the atmosphere.</p>
        <strong>Design Choices to Maximize Clarity and Accuracy</strong>
        <p>We created a stacked area chart which is separated by reference area, represented by different colors. The
            color encodings are explained through the legend, and the filter allows viewers to select specific reference
            areas they would like to view data for. The reference areas are sorted alphabetically, both in the
            legend/filter and in the visualization, which allows for quick lookup by area name.</p>
        <p>The area chart allows viewers to more easily pinpoint when there is no more data after a certain year for a
            reference area compared to lines or marks, so they do not mistake the lack of data for a downward trend,
            which may lead to accidental bias. The dataset is missing a lot of data for countries like India, China,
            Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Indonesia, so it was imperative to communicate that lack of data to avoid potential
            bias and maintain transparency. </p>
        <p>We also computed the average value of emissions per reference area across 2014 to 2022 by filtering the
            emissions data by reference area using Excel and calculating the average. This allows us to compare the
            total emissions in each year to the average observed in each reference area. It also provides a rough but
            quick comparison between emissions of different reference areas. </p>
        <p>Since we want to maximize clarity, we added a tooltip function that will show the reference area, year,
            emissions for that year, and average emissions over 2014 to 2022 for that area. The combination of the
            tooltip and filtering will allow viewers to more precisely explore the data to ensure accuracy in the
            conclusions they draw or trends they discover.</p>
