        <h1>Assignment 3: White Hat/Black Hat</h1>
        <h3>1. White Hat</h3>
        <strong>The Dataset</strong>
        <p>The dataset we used for the White Hat visualization is the Greenhouse Gas Emissions data. We used data from
            years 2014 to 2022 for total emissions excluding land use and forestry, measured in thousands of kilograms
            of CO2-equivalent emissions per person. </p>
        <p>We chose to focus on how the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions have changed over time across the
            world, which led us to filter the data solely into the year, the total emissions, and the reference area. We
            chose to include all pollutants, since all of them contribute to the effect of the greenhouse gas presence
            in the atmosphere.</p>
        <strong>Design Choices to Maximize Clarity and Accuracy</strong>
        <p>We created a stacked area chart which is separated by reference area, represented by different colors. The
            color encodings are explained through the legend, and the filter allows viewers to select specific reference
            areas they would like to view data for. The reference areas are sorted alphabetically, both in the
            legend/filter and in the visualization, which allows for quick lookup by area name.</p>
        <p>The area chart allows viewers to more easily pinpoint when there is no more data after a certain year for a
            reference area compared to lines or marks, so they do not mistake the lack of data for a downward trend,
            which may lead to accidental bias. The dataset is missing a lot of data for countries like India, China,
            Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Indonesia, so it was imperative to communicate that lack of data to avoid potential
            bias and maintain transparency. </p>
        <p>We also computed the average value of emissions per reference area across 2014 to 2022 by filtering the
            emissions data by reference area using Excel and calculating the average. This allows us to compare the
            total emissions in each year to the average observed in each reference area. It also provides a rough but
            quick comparison between emissions of different reference areas. </p>
        <p>Since we want to maximize clarity, we added a tooltip function that will show the reference area, year,
            emissions for that year, and average emissions over 2014 to 2022 for that area. The combination of the
            tooltip and filtering will allow viewers to more precisely explore the data to ensure accuracy in the
            conclusions they draw or trends they discover.</p>

        <!-- Black Hat Visualization -->
        <h3>2. Black Hat</h3>
        <p>This visualization presents kilograms of CO2-equivalent emissions per 1,000 US dollars from 2014 to 2022—but there's a twist. 
            Despite appearing to show an exponential rise in emissions, the graph actually misrepresents the data. Through the use of 
            distorted Y-axis scaling, deceptive transformations, and misleading labels, the visualization creates a false impression of 
            rapid growth. In truth, CO2 emissions per economic output have been gradually decreasing over time, not increasing as the chart suggests.
        </p>
        

        <ol>
            <li><strong>The first technique we used was to transform the data through a cumulative calculation:</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Instead of displaying the CO2 emissions for each individual year, this visualization presents the cumulative total from 2014 to 2022. 
                    This means that each year’s emissions are added to the previous years’, creating a running total. As a result, the values naturally 
                    increase over time, which can misleadingly suggest a rise in annual emissions when in reality, the yearly figures may be declining.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, in 2014-2016, the actual CO2 emissions generated per 1,000 US dollars are 0.39, 0.37, and 0.36 kilograms, respectively. 
                        However, because we show the running total of emissions, the actual plotted points are 0.39, 0.76, and 1.11 kilometers. This makes 
                        it seem like the CO2 emissions are increasing per year instead of decreasing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ol> <br>

            <li><strong>The second technique we used was to exaggerate the increase through Y-axis distortion:</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>First, we intentionally hid the Y-axis bar so that viewers couldn’t immediately recognize the irregular spacing between marks.</li>
                <li>Then, we plotted an exaggerated exponential curve to imply that CO2 emissions are rapidly increasing each year.</li>
                <li>Lastly, for each year, we plot the manipulated values (from cumulative calculations) onto the exponential line.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Without this manipulation, the data would be best represented by a steady, linear trend. However, by layering these techniques, 
                        the line of best fit appears exponential, falsely suggesting an accelerating emissions crisis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ol> <br>

            <li><strong>The last technique we used was to obfuscate the labels:</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>The chart title states that it displays CO2 emissions per 1,000 dollars in the United States, which suggests a straightforward year-by-year 
                    comparison. However, a closer look at the Y-axis label reveals that the values represent a running total, not the annual emissions. This 
                    subtle discrepancy can easily mislead viewers into thinking the chart shows yearly data, when in fact, the emissions are cumulatively stacked.</li>
            </ol> <br>
            
            <li>For a finishing touch, we decided to make the line red to emphasize the sense of urgency and danger associated with rising emissions. Red is often psychologically 
                associated with warnings, heat, and alarm, so using it here amplifies the emotional impact of the visualization.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>This visualization might appeal to someone trying to emphasize the urgency of climate change, regardless of what the data actually shows .Their goal may be to trigger 
            an emotional response—like concern or alarm—by using visual tricks that suggest the situation is getting worse. By exaggerating trends and hiding the true values, 
            the chart leads viewers to believe that climate change is rapidly accelerating, even if the data doesn’t fully support that narrative.

    <h4><strong>An overview of your development process.</strong></h4>
    <h5>Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on
        the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your 
        application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time?</h5>
    <div>
        <p>Each member of the team created one visualization and wrote the corresponding writeup. We collaborated 
            on dataset selection, what we wanted to show through the two visualizations, and Tableau use and troubleshooting. 
            We also reviewed and edited the writeups and embedded our Tableau visualizations in an HTML webpage. We each spent 
            about 4 hours developing the visualizations and writeups, and 2 hours putting everything in our public webpage. 
            This totals to about 10 hours. The most time consuming aspects were familiarizing ourselves with the data and how 
            to manipulate it in Tableau. It was difficult to work with the data with the same approach we took for the sample 
            data from the in-class lab. We had to perform additional filtering and computation to achieve what we wanted in 
            each chart.
